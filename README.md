# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
PyBer company requested to review some of their rides data to improve access to get insights about determine affordability for under-served neighborhoods. We are providing a complete analysis that gives us an idea of fares obtainded in three different types of cities (Urban, Semiurban and Rural) through the use of written and visual reports, submitting business recommendations to PyBer decision-makers for addressing disparities among the city types.

## Results

As we can see inthe chart above, the results shows us the difference in volume of rides between the type of city, giving us an idea of the use case scenarios based on the Average Fare Per Ride taking in consideration that the higher the average fare the longer the rides are being. This analysis also shows us the parity between Total rides and Total Drivers that at the end is a good indicator of the worth of each ride depending of the type of the city.

If we pay attention to the chart that we got from the analysis we can see a common peak at the end of February, this is reflected as an increment of total fees during that period of time, if we get to analize a longer timestamp, compare it with data from 2019 and a pattern of repetition during the same period of time is found, that could give PyBer a valuable insight for them to look for any campaign that may benefit the company exploiting higher demand on a known time of the year.

## Summary

- Rural is the most profitable city type despite the high density of drivers related to total rides (demand).
- Urban has the highest Total Fares, but the lowest fare per driver, also the total drivers are above the total number of rides (demand is below actual ride capacity at that type of city).
- Further Fare vs Time should be done to identify bussiness opportunity during certain yearly events.
